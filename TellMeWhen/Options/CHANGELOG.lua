TMW.CHANGELOG = [==[
## v8.6.3
### Bug Fixes
* Fixed #1698 (again): Utils.lua:438: attempt to index local 'path' (a number value)
* Switched WoW-built-in sounds that TMW registers with LSM to use FileDataIDs instead of paths, since paths aren't allowed anymore in WoW 8.2.
 * Note that if you have other addons which are still incorrectly registering these sounds (like Omen), they won't work for you.

## v8.6.2
### Bug Fixes
* Fixed #1698: Utils.lua:438: attempt to index local 'path' (a number value)
* Fixed #1699: Several lists when editing notifications were no longer displaying correctly, if at all, in WoW 8.2.

## v8.6.1
* Buff/Debuff equivalency improvements
* Added Kul Tiran and Zandalari to the Unit Race condition

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed #1690: Framelevel issue with latest alphas of Masque.
* Fixed #1694: Empty group shrinks to minimum size of 1 icon.
* Fixed that Reactive Ability icons wouldn't use the No Mana state.
* Fixed #1697: Error when logging in in WoW 8.2.

## v8.6.0

### Discord
* TellMeWhen now has a Discord! Come ask questions, share configuration, or just hang out with other TellMeWhen users. https://discord.gg/NH7RmcP

### General
* Created a new system to collect performance metrics on a per-icon basis. You can view this new feature via `/tmw cpu` or under the "Performance" section in the main options.
 * This feature is for advanced users. No instructions or guidance will be provided on how to use it or how to interpret the data.
* Added a Scale setting to the Activation Border animation.
* You can now toggle an icon's enabled/disabled state by Ctrl+clicking it. (#22)
* New setting for Combat Event icons: Only if Conditions Passing. (#20)
* Unit Conditions can now be copied from one icon to another. (#18)
* Added Raise Abomination to the totem icon type for DKs (#1688)

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug that caused export strings to sometimes contain a large amount of superfluous defaults.

## v8.5.9
### Bug Fixes
* Fixed GitHub #12 - A major bug introduced by a last-minute change in v8.5.8 that broke all icons that check multiple units.

## v8.5.8
* Groups now use `:SetFlattensRenderLayers(true)`, which should prevent other frames from appearing in between the different parts of the group and its icons.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed #1631 - The Frame Level setting should no longer be prevented from having an effect until the next UI reload due to a change Blizzard has made recently to the way that `:SetToplevel(true)` works. A side effect of this fix is that clicking a group to configure it or its icons will no longer bring that group above others on your screen if you have overlapping groups.
* Item cooldown icons no longer incorrectly show timers for items whose cooldowns are pending start, like potions used in combat.
* Fixed #1644 - ConditionObject.lua line 435: attempt to index local 'unit' (a number value)

## v8.5.7
* Bump the TOC version to 8.1 now that Blizzard finally remembered to increment it on their end.
* Significant updates to buff/debuff eqauivalencies (thanks to user Jalopyy!)

## v8.5.6
* You can now use "thisunit" in Lua conditions as a reference to the current unit in any Unit Conditions.
* Made a number of performance optimizations around Unit Conditions.
* Unit Condition Icons:
 * Now correctly pass the icon's unit to the icon's text displays for use as the default unit.
 * When acting as a Group Controller, will no longer create blank spots if the opacity is set to Hidden for the data that would otherwise be displayed in that spot. This new behavior is the same behavior of most other icon types.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed #1615 - Critical Strike condition throwing error "attempt to call global 'max' (a nil value)"
* Fixed #1618 - Conditions on Combat Event source/destination units that used event-driven updates could be in an incorrect state before the first time an update is needed.

## v8.5.5
* A few improvements to the spell equivalency lists.
* Added Keystone Level condition for Mythic+.
* The Unit Reaction condition now checks specifically if the subject is attackable by you. This prevents false positives on, for example, the opposite-faction guards in Dalaran.

### Bug Fixes
* Hopefully fixed #1572 - "Script ran too long" when zoning into an arena.
* Fixed #1584 - Error when switching profiles via slash command.
* Fixed #1586 - Fixed a timing issue related to detecting the GCD that could cause "While condition set passing" triggered animations to flicker if their conditions were based on cooldowns.
* Fixed #1611 - Conditions on the destination units for a Combat Event icon will now be used (previously destination units were using the source unit conditions by mistake).
* Fixed #1600 - Lua inputs were causing unrecoverable freezes in WoW 8.1 because `EditBox:Insert()` now silently ignores non-printing characters.

## v8.5.4
* New icon drag operation - Insert.
* Added Dark Icon and Mag'har to Unit Race condition.
* Added Stagger to the Resouce Display icon type.

### Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed #1534 - Attempt to register unknown event "WORLD_MAP_UPDATE"
* Fixed cusor position in tall textboxes sometimes being incorrect due to a Blizzard bug with FontString:SetSpacing()
* Fixed handling of pipe characters in export strings.

## v8.5.1
* Changed DR reset duration to 20 seconds from 18 to increase consistency.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed #1509 - "Couldn't open Interface/AddOns/TellMeWhen_Options/"

* Fixed #1521 - ComponentsCoreUtils.lua line 574: attempt to index local 'str' (a nil value)

## v8.4.5
