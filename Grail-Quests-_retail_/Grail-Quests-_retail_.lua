--		OPC:pat		where pat is a pattern (see below) of prerequisites that need to be met before other OxC: codes that use OPC: rules will do their actions
--		OTC:pat		where pat is a comma-separated list of plus-separated pairs where the first in the pair is an NPC ID and the second is the quest ID to complete
--		P:pat		where pat is a pattern (see below) of quests considered to be prerequisites
--		DEPRECATED	Pxyyy		where x is the key to a required profession and yyy is the minimum skill (see professionMapping).
--		Qx:QualifiedPattern	is completed when a Gossip number x is peformed with the first matching NPC from the QualifiedPattern

--		SP			indicated the quest is a special one that never appears in the quest log
--		T:list		where list (see below) is the list of NPCs where the quest is turned in by anyone
--		TA:list		where list (see below) is the list of NPCs where the quest is turned in by Alliance only
--		TH:list		where list (see below) is the list of NPCs where the quest is turned in by Horde only
--		Ux			where x is the follower ID obtained when completing the quest
--		DEPRECATED	Vxxyyyyy	where xx is the key to the required reputation and yyyyy is the minimum number of earned points in it (see reputationMapping).  note that you add 42000 to earned value.
--			hated: 0   hostile: 35999   unfriendly: 38999
--			neutral: 41999   friendly: 44999   honored: 50999   revered: 62999   exalted: 83999
--			Acquaintance: 50399   Buddy: 58799   Friend: 67199
--			Good Friend: 75599   Best Friend: 83999 (just like exalted)
--		Wxxx		where xxx is the number of the group to which these weekly quests belong
--		Xx			where x is the key to an excluded class (see classMapping).  if no Xx is present any class can accept the quest.  mutually exclusive with Cx codes.
--		Y:questId	where questId represents the quest that this quest is an alias for
--		Zxxxxx		where xxxxx is the Blizzard release version past where this quest does not exist
--
--		Both A: and T: codes have a modification to AP: and TP: that allow a pattern to indicate a specific NPC is used when certain prequisites are matched and
--		allows a list of these NPCs.  The first NPC matching prerequisites is used.  An example:
--			AP:12345:H123+S345;23456:P12321+P45678
--			NPC 12345 is valid when H123+S345    and NPC 23456 is valid when P12321+P45678
--		Semicolon separates prerequisite phrases.  If there is no colon after the NPC id, then the NPC is always valid.
--
--		When an NPC phases, we make an alias NPC and use the AP:/TP: structure to handle this.  If we were to attempt to actually apply the prerequisite information on
--		the NPC itslef to represent the phasing we would lose the capability to map locations properly that are not in the current phase.  Therefore, alias NPCs are used
--		for the proper NPC for each quest part.
--
--	Patterns for prerequisites and invalidations is a comma-separated list of quests, any of which match.  Within the comma-separated list there
--	can be plus-separated values that indicate each of them must match.  For example, the following code:
--		123,456,789+1122,3344
--	means any of the following quests would match the pattern:
--		123
--		456
--		both 789 and 1122 (together)
--		3344
--
--	Lists are just comma-separated values.
