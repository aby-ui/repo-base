@CODElocal combat = Details:GetCombat (segmentID = DETAILS_SEGMENTID_CURRENT)@

@DESCFor overall use DETAILS_SEGMENTID_OVERALL, for older segments use the combat index (1 ... 25), when the current combat ends, it is added to index 1 on the old segments table.@


@TITLE- Getting a player:@

@DESCThere's several ways to get a player object, the quick way is:@

@CODElocal player = Details:GetActor (segmentID = DETAILS_SEGMENTID_CURRENT, attributeID = DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_DAMAGE, "PlayerName")@

@DESCThe segmentID is the same as described on GetCombat(), attributeID is the ID for the attribute type.
there is an alias which receives the player name as the first parameter: Details:GetPlayer (playerName, segmentID, attributeID), combat also accept GetActor(): combat:GetActor (attributeID, playerName).
Retriving actors is expensive, try to cache the object once you have it.

@TITLECustom Displays@
@DESCis a special display where users can set their own rules.
There is 4 scripts which composes a custom display:@

@TITLERequired:@
@DESCSearch: the main script, it's responsible to search and build what the window will show.@

@TITLEOptional:@
@DESCTooltip: runs when the user hover over a bar.
Total: helps format the total done number.
Percent: formats the percent number amount.@


@TITLESearch Code:@
@DESC- The script receives 3 parameters: *Combat, *CustomContainer and *Instance.
*Combat - is the reference for the selected combat shown in the window (the one selected on segments menu).
*CustomContainer - is the place where the display mantain stored the results, Details! get the content inside the container and use to update the window.
*Instance - is the reference of the window where the custom display is shown.

- Also, the script must return three values: total made by all players, the amount of the top player and the amount of players found by the script.
- The search script basically begins getting these three parameters and declaring our three return values:@

@CODElocal Combat, CustomContainer, Instance = ...
local total, top, amount = 0, 0, 0@

@DESC- Then, we build our search for wherever we want to show, here we are building an example for Damage Done by Pets and Guardians.
- So, as we are working with damage, we want to get a list of Actors from the Damage Container of the combat and iterate it with ipairs:@

@CODElocal damage_container = combat:GetActorList( DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_DAMAGE )
for i, actor in ipairs( damage_container ) do
	--do stuff
end@

@DESC- Actor, can be anything, a monster, player, boss, etc, so, we need to check if actor is a pet:@

@CODEif (actor:IsPetOrGuardian()) then
	--do stuff
end@

@DESC- Now we found a pet, we need to get the damage done and find who is the owner of this pet, after that, we also need to check if the owner is a player:@

@CODElocal petOwner = actor.owner
if (petOwner:IsPlayer()) then
	local petDamage = actor.total
end@

@DESC- The next step is add the pet owner into the CustomContainer:@

@CODECustomContainer:AddValue (petOwner, petDamage)@

@DESC- And in the and, we need to get the total, top and amount values. This is generally calculated inside our loop above, but just calling the API for the result is more handy:@

@CODEtotal, top = CustomContainer:GetTotalAndHighestValue()
amount = CustomContainer:GetNumActors()
return total, top, amount@


@DESCThe finished script looks like this:@
@CODE
local Combat, CustomContainer, Instance = ...
local total, top, amount = 0, 0, 0

local damage_container = Combat:GetActorList( DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_DAMAGE )
for i, actor in ipairs( damage_container ) do
 if (actor:IsPetOrGuardian()) then
  local petOwner = actor.owner
  if (petOwner:IsPlayer()) then
   local petDamage = actor.total
   CustomContainer:AddValue( petOwner, petDamage )
  end
 end
end

total, top = CustomContainer:GetTotalAndHighestValue()
amount = CustomContainer:GetNumActors()

return total, top, amount
@

Tooltip Code:
- The script receives 3 parameters: *Actor, *Combat and *Instance. This script has no return value.
*Actor - in our case, actor is the petOwner.

local Actor, Combat, Instance = ...
local Format = Details:GetCurrentToKFunction()

- What we want where is show all pets the player used in the combat and how much damage each one made.
- The member .pets gives us a table with pet names that belongs to the actor.

local actorPets = Actor.pets

- Next move is iterate this table and get the pet actor from the combat.
- In Details! always use ">= 1" not "> 0", also when not using our format functions, use at least floor()

for i, petName in ipairs( actorPets ) do
 local petActor = Combat( DETAILS_ATTRIBUTE_DAMAGE, petName)
 if (petActor and petActor.total >= 1) then
  --do stuff
 end
end

- With the pet in hands, what we have to do now is add this pet to our tooltip.
- Details! uses 'GameCooltip' which is slight different than 'GameTooltip':

GameCooltip:AddLine( petName, Format( nil, petActor.total ) )
Details:AddTooltipBackgroundStatusbar()


The finished script looks like this:

local Actor, Combat, Instance = ...
local Format = Details:GetCurrentToKFunction()

local actorPets = Actor.pets

Total Code and Percent Code:
- Details! build the total and the percent automatically, these scripts are for special cases where you want to show something different, e.g. convert total into seconds/minutes.
- Both scripts receives 5 parameters, three are new to us:
*Value - the total made by this actor.
*Top - the value made by the rank 1 actor.
*Total - the total made by all actors.

Custom Container Object:
A custom container is primarily used when building custom displays.
Is used to hold values for any kind of actor in Details! and also any other table as long as it has a ".name" or ".id" key.

value = is a number indicating the actor's score, the container doesn't know what kind of actor it is holding, if is a damage actor, energy, a spell, so, it is just nominated 'value'.

container:GetValue ( actor )
returns the current value for the requested actor.

container:AddValue ( actor, amountToAdd, checkTop, nameComplement )
actor is any actor object or any other table containing a member "name" or "id", e.g. {name = "Jeff"} {id = 186451}
amountToAdd is the amount to add to this actor on the container.
checkTop is for some special cases when the top value needs to be calculated immediately.
nameComplement is a string to add on the end of the actor's name, for instance, in cases where the actor is a spell and its name is generated by the container.
returns the current value for the actor.

container:SetValue (actor, amount, nameComplement)
actor is any actor object or any other table containing a member "name" or "id", e.g. {name = "Jeff"} {id = 186451}
amount is the amount to set to this actor on the container.
nameComplement is a string to add on the end of the actor's name, for instance, in cases where the actor is a spell and its name is generated by the container.

container:HasActor (actor)
return true if the container holds a reference for 'actor'.

container:GetNumActors()
returns the amount of actors present inside the container.

container:GetTotalAndHighestValue()
return 'total' and 'top' values.
total is the total of value of all actors together.
top is the amount of value of the actor with more value.

container:WipeCustomActorContainer()
removes all data from a custom container.
this is automatically performed when the search script runs.
